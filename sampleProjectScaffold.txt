Project Title: Building a Simple React Application
Objective:
By the end of this project, students will have created a basic React application that displays a list of items and allows users to add new items.

Phases and Tasks:

Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment
Objective: Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.
Install Node.js and npm:
Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
Create a New React Project:
Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
Instructions: Open your terminal and run npx create-react-app my-react-app.
Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.
Project Structure Overview:
Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

Phase 2: Understanding JSX and Components
Objective: Learn about JSX and create basic React components.
Introduction to JSX:
Task: Read about JSX syntax and its role in React.
Resources: Provide a brief tutorial or video explaining JSX.
Create a Simple Component:
Task: Create a new component called ItemList that renders a static list of items.
Instructions: Write a functional component that returns a div containing an unordered list (<ul>) with list items (<li>).
Render the Component:
Task: Render the ItemList component in the main App component.
Instructions: Import ItemList into App.js and include it in the JSX returned by App.

Phase 3: State and Props
Objective: Understand the state and props in React and how to use them.
Introduction to State:
Task: Read about the useState hook and state management in functional components.
Resources: Provide a tutorial or documentation link about useState.
Add State to ItemList:
Task: Modify the ItemList component to use state to manage the list of items.
Instructions: Initialize the state with an array of items and render the list based on this state.
Passing Props:
Task: Create a new component called Item that takes a prop for the item text.
Instructions: Modify ItemList to map over the list of items and render an Item component for each, passing the item text as a prop.

Phase 4: Handling Events
Objective: Learn how to handle user input and events in React.
Introduction to Event Handling:
Task: Read about handling events in React.
Resources: Provide links to React documentation on event handling.
Add Item Input:
Task: Add an input field and a button to ItemList to allow users to add new items.
Instructions: Use state to manage the input value and create an event handler for the button click to add the input value to the list of items.
Update State with New Items:
Task: Implement the functionality to update the state with new items when the button is clicked.
Instructions: Ensure the new item is added to the list and the input field is cleared after adding.

Phase 5: Styling the Application
Objective: Apply basic styles to make the application visually appealing.
Introduction to Styling in React:
Task: Read about different ways to style React components (CSS, inline styles, CSS-in-JS).
Resources: Provide a tutorial on styling methods in React.
Apply Basic CSS:
Task: Create a CSS file for ItemList and apply styles to the list and items.
Instructions: Import the CSS file into ItemList and add class names to the elements for styling.
Enhance UI:
Task: Improve the appearance of the input field and button.
Instructions: Use CSS to style the input and button to make the UI more user-friendly.

Final Project Submission
Combine All Phases: Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
Code Review and Feedback: Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
Project Presentation: Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

Assessment Criteria
Functionality: The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
Code Quality: The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
Styling: The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
Understanding: The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.
This scaffolded project provides a step-by-step approach to learning React, helping students build confidence and competence in developing basic React applications.
